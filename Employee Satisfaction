1.Front-end:
Develop a user interface (UI) that prompts a series of questions to the employee.
The questions should cover various aspects of an employee's job satisfaction such as job role, work-life balance, communication with colleagues and management, opportunities for growth, etc.
Provide a rating scale (e.g. 1-5, 1-10) for each question so that the employee can provide a numerical value for their satisfaction level.
2.Back-end:
Create a database to store the employee's answers to the survey questions.
Develop a script that processes the data and generates relevant reports.
The reports should provide an overall employee satisfaction index as well as a breakdown of the satisfaction levels for each question.
3.Reports:
Create a dashboard that displays the employee satisfaction index and the breakdown of satisfaction levels for each question.
Allow the user to filter the data by department, job role, or other attributes.
Allow the user to download the report in various formats (e.g. PDF, Excel).
4.Security:
Implement authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access the application and the data.
Encrypt the data stored in the database to protect against unauthorized access.
5.Maintenance:
Regularly update the questions to keep the survey relevant and to ensure that it continues to provide useful insights into employee satisfaction.
Monitor the performance of the application and fix any issues that arise.
6.Deployment:
Deploy the application on a web server so that it can be accessed by employees from any location.
